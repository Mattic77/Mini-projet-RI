Information Retrieval System – Inverted Index & TF-IDF Search

This project implements a lightweight Information Retrieval (IR) pipeline using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
It was originally created as an academic / research project to explore concepts like:

Document preprocessing

Inverted index construction

TF-IDF computation

Query parsing & ranking

Search using cosine similarity

Storing processed documents in MongoDB

The system loads raw text documents, preprocesses them, builds an inverted index, and provides a search endpoint that returns relevant documents ranked by score.
